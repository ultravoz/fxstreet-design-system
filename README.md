# FXStreet 3.0 front-end dev
Frontend less, css &amp; html designs for FXS templates.
CSS & Less structure is the same as the dev app, HTML are only templates.

The architecture is builded with the "<a href="http://patternlab.io/about.html">Atomic design</a>" approach.

In order to ensure maintenance and scalability, each group of components are divided into different files and imported into the final "fxs_screen.min.css".
